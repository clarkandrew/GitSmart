## Executive Summary

**c-01** is a CLI tool designed to streamline the process of generating and committing git messages using an external AI service. It provides a user-friendly interface for reviewing diffs, staging/unstaging files, and generating commit messages.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Commit Messages**: Leverage AI to generate meaningful commit messages.
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly interface for managing git changes.
- **Styled Output**: Enhanced readability with rich-styled output.

## Target Use Cases

- Developers looking to automate commit message generation.
- Teams aiming to maintain consistent commit message quality.
- Users who prefer an interactive CLI for git operations.

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Git installed
- Internet connection

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-01.git
cd c-01
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a `config.ini` file in the root directory with the following content:

```ini
[API]
auth_token = YOUR_API_TOKEN
api_url = YOUR_API_URL
model = YOUR_MODEL
max_tokens = 100
temperature = 0.7
```

### Running the CLI

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Version History

- **1.0.0**: Initial release

## Release Roadmap

- **1.1.0**: Add support for custom commit message templates
- **1.2.0**: Enhance diff visualization with syntax highlighting

## Detailed Installation Procedures

### Windows

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment Configuration Requirements

- Ensure `config.ini` is properly configured with your API credentials.

## API Reference

### `generate_commit_message(diff: str) -> str`

Generates a commit message using the provided git diff.

**Parameters**:
- `diff` (str): The git diff to generate a commit message for.

**Returns**:
- `str`: The generated commit message.

## Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- Ensure your API token is securely stored and not hardcoded in the source code.
- Regularly update dependencies to the latest versions.

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

- Minimize the size of diffs to reduce API request time.
- Use caching mechanisms for repeated API calls.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

- **API Request Failure**: Ensure your API token and URL are correct.
- **Git Command Errors**: Verify that git is installed and accessible from the CLI.

## Known Limitations

- Performance may degrade with very large diffs.
- Limited by the rate limits of the external API.

## Upgrade/Migration Guides

### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

- Update `config.ini` to include new configuration options.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to update dependencies.
