- **Network Access**: Outbound internet access for API calls.

---

## API Reference

### Function: `generate_commit_message(diff: str) -> str`

Generates a commit message using the AI service.

**Parameters**

- `diff` (str): The git diff of staged changes.

**Returns**

- `str`: The generated commit message.

**Example**

```python
diff = get_git_diff(staged=True)
commit_message = generate_commit_message(diff)
print(commit_message)
```

## Release Roadmap

### Upcoming Features

- **1.1.0**

  - Integration with multiple AI service providers.
  - Customizable commit templates.

- **1.2.0**

  - GUI version for non-CLI users.
  - Enhanced diff visualization with syntax highlighting.

- **1.3.0**

  - Support for non-git version control systems.
  - Multi-language support for commit messages.

---

## Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- **Secure API Credentials**: Do not commit `config.ini` to version control.
- **Automate with Pre-Commit Hooks**: Integrate **c-01** into your git workflow.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies up-to-date for security and performance.

---

## Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **Limit Diff Size**: Stage only relevant changes to speed up AI processing.
- **Adjust `max_tokens`**: Configure `max_tokens` in `config.ini` based on your needs.
- **Cache API Responses**: Implement caching if you're regenerating commits for the same diff.

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Authentication Errors**

  - *Solution*: Verify your `auth_token` in `config.ini`.

- **No Staged Changes Detected**

  - *Solution*: Ensure you've staged changes using `git add`.

- **Network Timeouts**

  - *Solution*: Check your internet connection and proxy settings.

---

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

- **Large Diffs**

  - *Limitation*: Processing very large diffs may slow down the commit generation.
  - *Workaround*: Stage changes in smaller batches.

- **API Rate Limits**

  - *Limitation*: Exceeding API limits may result in errors.
  - *Workaround*: Upgrade your API plan or implement rate limiting in your usage.
