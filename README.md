**Step-by-Step Thinking:**

1. **Observations**:
   - The `README.md` file has been modified to update an image link.
   - Specifically, the `GitSmart Overview Image` source has changed from `assets/comit.png` to `assets/no-bg.png`.
   - A new file, `no-bg.png`, has been added to the `assets` directory.
   - The nature of the change suggests a visual update, potentially for aesthetic or branding reasons.

2. **Rationale**:
   - Chosen Icon: ðŸ’„ (for UI improvements, as the change affects the visual aspect of the project)
   - Theme: Update of graphical asset for potential branding or layout adjustments.

<COMMIT_MESSAGE>
ðŸ’„ Update README Image Asset

**WHAT:** Replaced `comit.png` with `no-bg.png` in README.md
**WHY:** Refresh project's visual identity by updating the GitSmart Overview Image to a new version without background (`no-bg.png`), enhancing overall UI consistency and appeal.

**DETAILS:**
- **Affected File(s):**
  - `README.md`: Updated image link to reflect new asset.
  - `assets/no-bg.png`: Newly added image file, replacing the original `comit.png`.
- **Impact:** This change modernizes the project's front-facing visuals in the README, ensuring a more engaging and up-to-date first impression for visitors.
</COMMIT_MESSAGE>

---

## **Technical Implementation**

### Installation Procedures for Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. **Install Python and Git**

   - **Python**: Download from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Git**: Download from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Follow the Quick Start Guide**

   Proceed with cloning the repository and installing dependencies as outlined above.

### Environment Configuration Requirements

- **Python Packages**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **API Credentials**: Valid `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.
- **Network Access**: Internet connection is required for API calls.

### API Reference

#### Function: `generate_commit_message(diff: str) -> str`

Generates a commit message using the AI service.

**Parameters**

- `diff` (str): The Git diff of staged changes.

**Returns**

- `str`: The generated commit message.

**Example**

```python
diff = get_git_diff(staged=True)
commit_message = generate_commit_message(diff)
print(commit_message)
```

### Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- **Secure API Credentials**: Keep your `config.ini` file out of version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
- **Automate with Git Hooks**: Integrate **GitSmart** into your Git workflow using pre-commit hooks.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically update dependencies for security and performance improvements.

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **Limit Diff Size**: Stage only relevant changes to reduce processing time.
- **Adjust AI Settings**: Modify `max_tokens` and `temperature` in `config.ini` to balance performance and output quality.
- **Cache Responses**: Implement caching if you frequently regenerate commit messages for the same changes.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Authentication Errors**
  - *Solution*: Verify your `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.

- **No Staged Changes Detected**
  - *Solution*: Stage your changes using `git add <file>` before running **GitSmart**.

- **Network Timeouts**
  - *Solution*: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

### Known Limitations and Workarounds

- **Large Diffs**
  - *Limitation*: Processing very large diffs may slow down the AI response.
  - *Workaround*: Commit changes in smaller batches.

- **API Rate Limits**
  - *Limitation*: Exceeding API limits may result in errors.
  - *Workaround*: Monitor your usage or upgrade your API plan.
