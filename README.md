## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Git**: Installed and configured on your system.
- **API Access**: An API key from our AI service provider.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C0MIT.git
   cd C0MIT
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Application**

   Rename the example configuration file and update it with your API credentials:

   ```bash
   mv example.config.ini config.ini
   ```

   Edit `config.ini`:

   ```ini
   [API]
   auth_token = YOUR_API_TOKEN
   api_url = https://api.yourservice.com/v1/chat/completions
   model = your-model-name
   max_tokens = 500
   temperature = 0.7
   ```

### Running C0MIT

To use **C0MIT** from any Git directory, add it to your system's PATH:

1. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/C0MIT/src/main.py
   ```

2. **Add C0MIT to PATH**

   Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/C0MIT/src
   ```

   Reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Run C0MIT**

   In your Git repository, run:

   ```bash
   C0MIT
   ```

   Follow the on-screen prompts to generate and commit your changes.

## Technical Implementation

### Installation Procedures for Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. **Install Python and Git**

   - **Python**: Download from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Git**: Download from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Follow the Quick Start Guide**

   Proceed with cloning the repository and installing dependencies as outlined above.

### Environment Configuration Requirements

- **Python Packages**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **API Credentials**: Valid `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.
- **Network Access**: Internet connection is required for API calls.

### API Reference

#### Function: `generate_commit_message(diff: str) -> str`

Generates a commit message using the AI service.

**Parameters**

- `diff` (str): The Git diff of staged changes.

**Returns**

- `str`: The generated commit message.

**Example**

```python
diff = get_git_diff(staged=True)
commit_message = generate_commit_message(diff)
print(commit_message)
```

### Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- **Secure API Credentials**: Keep your `config.ini` file out of version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
- **Automate with Git Hooks**: Integrate **C0MIT** into your Git workflow using pre-commit hooks.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically update dependencies for security and performance improvements.

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **Limit Diff Size**: Stage only relevant changes to reduce processing time.
- **Adjust AI Settings**: Modify `max_tokens` and `temperature` in `config.ini` to balance performance and output quality.
- **Cache Responses**: Implement caching if you frequently regenerate commit messages for the same changes.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Authentication Errors**
  - *Solution*: Verify your `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.

- **No Staged Changes Detected**
  - *Solution*: Stage your changes using `git add <file>` before running **C0MIT**.

- **Network Timeouts**
  - *Solution*: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

### Known Limitations and Workarounds

- **Large Diffs**
  - *Limitation*: Processing very large diffs may slow down the AI response.
  - *Workaround*: Commit changes in smaller batches.

- **API Rate Limits**
  - *Limitation*: Exceeding API limits may result in errors.
  - *Workaround*: Monitor your usage or upgrade your API plan.
