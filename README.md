**C0MIT** is an open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate the creation of meaningful Git commit messages. By analyzing the changes you've made, **C0MIT** generates concise and standardized commit messages, making it easier to track changes and collaborate with others.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Commit Messages**: Automatically generate meaningful and standardized commit messages based on your code changes.
- **Track Changes**: Maintain a detailed history of modifications to your codebase.
- **Revert to Previous Versions**: Easily roll back to earlier states of your project.
- **Branch and Merge**: Experiment with new ideas without affecting the main project branch.
- **Collaborate Seamlessly**: Work with others by merging changes and resolving conflicts efficiently.

### AI-driven Chain-of-Thought analysis for deep understanding of any change:
```shell
**Step-by-Step Thinking:**

1. **Observations**: A new file `main.py` has been created that contains a complete implementation for a CLI tool to manage git commit messages. It integrates several functionalities such as generating commit messages based on staged changes, styling console output with the `rich` library, handling user interactions with `questionary`, and managing file statuses in git. The file includes various functions for displaying diffs, handling file staging/unstaging, and interacting with the git repository.
2. **Rationale**: âœ¨ for the introduction of new features, ðŸ’„ for UI improvements, and ðŸ“¦ for the addition of a new package.

<COMMIT_MESSAGE>âœ¨ðŸ’„ðŸ“¦ (main.py): implement CLI tool for automated git commit message generation

Introduced a new CLI tool that automates the generation of git commit messages based on staged changes. The tool utilizes the `rich` library for styled console output and `questionary` for user interactions. Key functionalities include displaying diffs for staged changes, staging and unstaging files, and generating commit messages through an external service. This implementation enhances user experience and streamlines commit processes within git repositories.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C0MIT.git

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure the Application**

   Rename the example configuration file and update it with your API credentials:

   ```bash
   mv example.config.ini config.ini
   ```

   Edit `config.ini`:

   ```ini
   [API]
   auth_token = YOUR_API_TOKEN
   api_url = https://api.yourservice.com/v1/chat/completions
   model = your-model-name
   max_tokens = 500
   temperature = 0.7
   ```

### Running C0MIT

To use **C0MIT** from any Git directory, add it to your system's PATH:

1. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/C0MIT/src/main.py
   ```

2. **Add C0MIT to PATH**

   Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/C0MIT/src
   ```

   Reload your shell configuration:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Run C0MIT**

   In your Git repository, run:

   ```bash
   C0MIT
   ```

   Follow the on-screen prompts to generate and commit your changes.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Installation Procedures for Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. **Install Python and Git**

   - **Python**: Download from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Git**: Download from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Follow the Quick Start Guide**

   Proceed with cloning the repository and installing dependencies as outlined above.

### Environment Configuration Requirements

- **Python Packages**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **API Credentials**: Valid `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.
- **Network Access**: Internet connection is required for API calls.

### API Reference

#### Function: `generate_commit_message(diff: str) -> str`

Generates a commit message using the AI service.

**Parameters**

- `diff` (str): The Git diff of staged changes.

**Returns**

- `str`: The generated commit message.

**Example**

```python
diff = get_git_diff(staged=True)
commit_message = generate_commit_message(diff)
print(commit_message)
```

### Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- **Secure API Credentials**: Keep your `config.ini` file out of version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
- **Automate with Git Hooks**: Integrate **C0MIT** into your Git workflow using pre-commit hooks.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically update dependencies for security and performance improvements.

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **Limit Diff Size**: Stage only relevant changes to reduce processing time.
- **Adjust AI Settings**: Modify `max_tokens` and `temperature` in `config.ini` to balance performance and output quality.
- **Cache Responses**: Implement caching if you frequently regenerate commit messages for the same changes.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Authentication Errors**
  - *Solution*: Verify your `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.

- **No Staged Changes Detected**
  - *Solution*: Stage your changes using `git add <file>` before running **C0MIT**.

- **Network Timeouts**
  - *Solution*: Check your internet connection and firewall settings.

### Known Limitations and Workarounds

- **Large Diffs**
  - *Limitation*: Processing very large diffs may slow down the AI response.
  - *Workaround*: Commit changes in smaller batches.

- **API Rate Limits**
  - *Limitation*: Exceeding API limits may result in errors.
  - *Workaround*: Monitor your usage or upgrade your API plan.
