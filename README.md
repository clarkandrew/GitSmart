**Step-by-Step Thinking:**

1. **Observations**:
   - The `README.md` file has been modified to update an image link.
   - Specifically, the `GitSmart Overview Image` source has changed from `assets/comit.png` to `assets/no-bg.png`.
   - A new file, `no-bg.png`, has been added to the `assets` directory.
   - The nature of the change suggests a visual update, potentially for aesthetic or branding reasons.

2. **Rationale**:
   - Chosen Icon: ðŸ’„ (for UI improvements, as the change affects the visual aspect of the project)
   - Theme: Update of graphical asset for potential branding or layout adjustments.
```

```markdown
<COMMIT_MESSAGE>
ðŸ’„ Update README Image Asset

**WHAT:** Replaced `comit.png` with `no-bg.png` in README.md
**WHY:** Refresh project's visual identity by updating the GitSmart Overview Image to a new version without background (`no-bg.png`), enhancing overall UI consistency and appeal.

**DETAILS:**
- **Affected File(s):**
  - `README.md`: Updated image link to reflect new asset.
  - `assets/no-bg.png`: Newly added image file, replacing the original `comit.png`.
- **Impact:** This change modernizes the project's front-facing visuals in the README, ensuring a more engaging and up-to-date first impression for visitors.
</COMMIT_MESSAGE>

## **Getting Started**

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

You can quickly set up GitSmart using our automated installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clarkandrew/GitSmart.git
cd GitSmart
chmod +x setup.sh
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Then run:
gitsmart

# or
c
```

This script will:
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create a configuration file
- Add convenient aliases (`gitsmart` and `c`) to your shell configuration

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clarkandrew/GitSmart.git
cd GitSmart
```

#### 2. Setup Python Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (requires Python 3.7 or higher):

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

#### 4. Configure the Application

Rename the example configuration file and update it with your API credentials:

```bash
cp example.config.ini config.ini
```

Edit `config.ini`:

```ini
[API]
auth_token = YOUR_API_TOKEN
api_url = https://api.yourservice.com/v1/chat/completions
model = your-model-name
max_tokens = 500
temperature = 0.7
```

#### 5. Setup Command Aliases

Add convenient aliases for `gitsmart` and `c` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
# Add these lines to your shell configuration file
alias gitsmart="python -m GitSmart.main"
alias c="python -m GitSmart.main"
```

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Running GitSmart

In any Git repository, you can now use:

```bash
gitsmart  # or the shorter alias
c
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to generate and commit your changes.

```

**Step-by-Step Thinking:**

1. **Observations**:
   - The `README.md` file has been modified to update an image link.
   - Specifically, the `GitSmart Overview Image` source has changed from `assets/comit.png` to `assets/no-bg.png`.
   - A new file, `no-bg.png`, has been added to the `assets` directory.
   - The nature of the change suggests a visual update, potentially for aesthetic or branding reasons.

2. **Rationale**:
   - Chosen Icon: ðŸ’„ (for UI improvements, as the change affects the visual aspect of the project)
   - Theme: Update of graphical asset for potential branding or layout adjustments.

**Example Commit Message:**
```
ðŸ’„ Update README Image Asset

**WHAT:** Replaced `comit.png` with `no-bg.png` in README.md
**WHY:** Refresh project's visual identity by updating the GitSmart Overview Image to a new version without background (`no-bg.png`), enhancing overall UI consistency and appeal.

**DETAILS:**
- **Affected File(s):**
  - `README.md`: Updated image link to reflect new asset.
  - `assets/no-bg.png`: Newly added image file, replacing the original `comit.png`.
- **Impact:** This change modernizes the project's front-facing visuals in the README, ensuring a more engaging and up-to-date first impression for visitors.

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

You can quickly set up GitSmart using our automated installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/clarkandrew/GitSmart.git
cd GitSmart
chmod +x setup.sh
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Then run:
gitsmart

# or
c
```

This script will:
- Set up a Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create a configuration file
- Add convenient aliases (`gitsmart` and `c`) to your shell configuration

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clarkandrew/GitSmart.git
cd GitSmart
```

#### 2. Setup Python Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (requires Python 3.7 or higher):

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

#### 4. Configure the Application

Rename the example configuration file and update it with your API credentials:

```bash
cp example.config.ini config.ini
```

Edit `config.ini`:

```ini
[API]
auth_token = YOUR_API_TOKEN
api_url = https://api.yourservice.com/v1/chat/completions
model = your-model-name
max_tokens = 500
temperature = 0.7
```

#### 5. Setup Command Aliases

Add convenient aliases for `gitsmart` and `c` to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
# Add these lines to your shell configuration file
alias gitsmart="python -m GitSmart.main"
alias c="python -m GitSmart.main"
```

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Running GitSmart

In any Git repository, you can now use:

```bash
gitsmart  # or the shorter alias
c
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to generate and commit your changes.

## Technical Implementation

### Installation Procedures for Windows, macOS, and Linux

1. **Install Python and Git**

   - **Python**: Download from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Git**: Download from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   Proceed with cloning the repository and installing dependencies as outlined above.

### Environment Configuration Requirements

- **Python Packages**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed.
- **API Credentials**: Valid `auth_token` and `api_url` in `config.ini`.
- **Network Access**: Internet connection is required for API calls.

### Integration Patterns and Best Practices

- **Secure API Credentials**: Keep your `config.ini` file out of version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
- **Automate with Git Hooks**: Integrate **GitSmart** into your Git workflow using pre-commit hooks.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically update dependencies for security and performance improvements.

### Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **Limit Diff Size**: Stage only relevant changes to reduce processing time.
- **Adjust AI Settings**: Modify `max_tokens` and `temperature` in `config.ini` to balance performance and output quality.
- **Cache Responses**: Implement caching if you frequently regenerate commit messages for the same changes.
